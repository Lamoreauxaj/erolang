# Ero

Welcome! We (Aaron Lamoreaux and
Anand Iyer) created Ero as a final project in CS429H: Computer Organization and
Architecture at UT Austin. Check out our proposal [here](/proposal.html). 
After this project is over, we will open source the language
and possibly continue development. Credit also goes to James Rayman for many of the
original ideas and working on an implementation of the interpreter and a virtual
reality renderer at HackDFW 2019.

## What is Ero?

Ero is a functional scripting language intended to describe and process Euclidean
constructions in two or three dimensions. Ero is inspired by *Elements*, an ancient
geometry textbook by Euclid of Alexandria. As a result, Ero does not focus on algebra
or arithmetic. Rather, it relies on geometry as its main method of computation, even
though real arithmetic is still supported. Ero is **Turing complete** (able to compute
anything which is computable) and **Euclidean complete** (able to construct any
Euclidean construction). Ero can also be used to create non-Euclidean constructions
(such as an angle trisection and squaring the circle).

"Ero" (pronounced like "arrow") was the name chosen for this language purely
because it was short, memorable, and not already taken. Whether or not there is
a deeper significance to this name is left as an exercise to the reader.

## Want to try the language?

We have set up an online demo editor which can compile your code [here](/demo.html).
For up to date information on the features of the language, make sure to check the
[docs](/docs/).
